1. The input field is empty

#### My implementations.

## What I learned
Hi everyone, another challenge completed, it was easy to do the logic, which by the way is in a `LogicApp.tsx` file, the request will be done via the GET method, I really wanted to learn POST, but nope, I don't know why I have errors. I would really appreciate it if you leave a comment of my code.
